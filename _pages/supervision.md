My research interests lie in two broad areas: Computer Systems and Computing Education. More specifically:

+ Computer Systems 
   + Heterogeneous, high-performance computing (HHPC)
   + Low-Carbon and Sustainable computing
   + High-level and accessible programming flows for FPGAs and GPUs, specially for Scientific Computing
   + Performance end energy optimization of scientific models and machine learning 
   + Performance and energy optimization of system software and database management systems

+ Computing Education
  + Competency-based learning and mastery learning
  + Reflective learning
  + Teaching foundational courses in computing
  + Computing and software engineering education for low and middle income countries (LMICs)
  + Use of AI in education
