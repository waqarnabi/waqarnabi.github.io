# PhD / MRes Applicants

I am currently recruiting PhD students, and you can look at some proposals I have floated on [our School's website here](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/phd-projects/#educationandpractice(eap),glasgowsystemssection(glass)) (search for any part of my name).

You can propose your own projects as well in any of the areas I have listed on my [Research](research.md) page.

Please reach out to me if you are interested. You don't have to have a full research proposal prepared before hand, but it would be good if you can share a brief of your idea, or indicate which of my proposals you might be interested in and why. You will eventually need to write a more detailed researh proposal, and [you can see guidance and sample proposals here](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/#writingacomputingscienceresearchproposal).

If you use Generative AI in any way at all for preparing your research proposal, please make you have followed Glasgow University's [Generative AI Guidance for Researchers](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/strategy/ourpolicies/ai-for-researchers/)
