I am currently recruiting PhD students, and you can look at some proposals I have floated on (our School's website here)[https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/phd-projects/#educationandpractice(eap),glasgowsystemssection(glass)] (search for any part of my name).

You can propose your own projects as well in any of the areas I have listed on my [Research](research.md) page.

Please reach out to me if you are interested. You don't have to have a full research proposal prepared before hand, but it would be good if you can share a brief of your idea, or indicate which of my proposals you might be interested in and why. You will eventually need to write a more detailed researh proposal, and (you can see guidance and sample proposals here)[https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/#writingacomputingscienceresearchproposal].
