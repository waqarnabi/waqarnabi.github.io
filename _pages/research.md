My research interests lie in two broad areas: Computing Systems, and Computing Education. 

+ Computer Systems 
   + Heterogeneous Computing
   + Modelling, Simulation, and Optimization of Computing Systems

+ Computing Education
  + Competency-Based Education, Work-Based Learning, and Mastery Learning
  + Computing Education in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs)

And an area that spans both domains:
+ Sustaiability, Responsibility and Equity in Computing Education and Practice

These are still quite high-level areas, and any given time I am focussed on something quite narrow within these domains. You can have a look at PhD projects I've proposed in [Supervision](supervision.md) and my publications on [Google Scholar organized by date here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kSwo6DcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for a better sense of my more recent priorities. I am happy to collaborate or supervise PhD scholars in any of these broad areas. 

I am quite keen on working with colleagues from other disciplines, and with international partners. 
  
These days I am actively recruting *PhD students*, please get in touch if you are interested, and be sure to look at the page on [Supervision](supervision.md) first. I am also very happy to be contacted by University of Glasgow's MSci, MSc, L4 or GA students for project-related discussions. 

I am committed to addressing [United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), with the following goals in focus:
+ #4 Quality Education
+ #10 Reduced Inequalities
+ #13 Climate Action
+ #17 Partnerships for the Goals

My research interests lie in two broad areas: Computer Systems and Computing Education. More specifically:

+ Computer Systems 
   + Heterogeneous, high-performance computing (HHPC)
   + Low-Carbon and Sustainable computing
   + High-level and accessible programming flows for FPGAs and GPUs, specially for Scientific Computing
   + Performance end energy optimization of scientific models and machine learning 
   + Performance and energy optimization of system software and database management systems

+ Computing Education
  + Competency-based learning and mastery learning
  + Reflective learning
  + Teaching foundational courses in computing
  + Computing and software engineering education for low and middle income countries (LMICs)
  + Use of AI in education
