I recorded a video discussing my research, aimed primarily at potential research students, [which you can watch here ](https://youtu.be/RrTyGAFoC2Q) [(slides here)](../files/nabi_phdinfosession-2025.pdf).

My research interests lie in two broad areas: Computing Systems, and Computing Education. 

+ **Computing Systems** (as part of the [Systems Research Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/))
   + [Cross-Layer Optimization of the Computing Stack](../files/nabi_computing-stack-2025.jpg)(emphasis on Compilers & High-Level Synthesis)
   + [Heterogeneous, High-Performance, and Scientific Computing](../files/nabi_heterogeneous-computing-2025.jpg)

+ **Computing Education** (as part of the [Education & Practice Research Section](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/educationandpracticeeap/))
  + Competency-Based Education, Work-Based Learning, and Mastery Learning
  + Computing Education in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs)

And an over-arching theme of interest that spans both domains:
+ **Sustainability, Responsibility and Equity in Computing Education, Research, and Practice**

These are still quite high-level areas, and at any given time I am usually focussed on something quite narrow within these domains in terms of my personal research at least, though my PhD supervision touches on all these areas. You can have a look at my current PhD students and their research topics and PhD projects I've proposed in [Supervision](supervision.md). You can see my publications on [Google Scholar organized by date here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kSwo6DcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for a better sense of my more recent priorities. I am happy to collaborate or supervise projects at PhD and other levels in any of these broad areas.

I am quite keen on working with colleagues from other disciplines, and with international partners. 
  
These days I am actively recruting *PhD students*, please get in touch if you are interested, and be sure to look at the page on [Supervision](supervision.md) first. I am also very happy to be contacted by University of Glasgow's MSci, MSc, L4 or GA students for project-related discussions. 

I am committed to addressing the [United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs)](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) through my research, [with the following goals in focus](../files/nabi_unsdgs-2025.jpg):
+ #4 Quality Education
+ #10 Reduced Inequalities
+ #13 Climate Action
+ #17 Partnerships for the Goals
