I am a Lecturer at the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). 

I am a member of [Education and Practice (EAP)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/educationandpracticeeap/) and co-lead the [Skills and Competencies Research Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/educationandpracticeeap/skillsandcompetenciesresearchgroup/).

I am also a member of the [Systems Research Centre (GLASS)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/), along with the cross-cutting [Low Carbon and Sustainable Computing theme](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchthemes/lowcarbon/).

I am a founding member two initiatives related to computing education in Pakistan: *PkCEP*, which is a conference on Computing Education Practice in Pakistan, and [ReCompute.pk](https://recompute-pk.github.io/), which is a forum for podcasts and a reading group related to higher education.

I teach mostly for the [BSc (Hons) Software Engineering (Graduate Apprenticeship) program](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/undergraduate/graduateapprenticeships/), covering foundational courses in the area of: logic design, computer architecture, operating systems, network systems, data structures, algorithms, and discrete maths. I am also closely involved in structuring and assessing workplace learning of the apprenticeship program.

Earlier, I was a post-doc on the EPSRC funded project “Exploiting Parallelism through Type Transformations for Hybrid Manycore Systems”, with my focus on targeting FPGA devices for accelerating scientific code. 

In another life, I was part of [Namal College, now University](https://namal.edu.pk/) in Pakistan, and for a while was deeply involved in various aspects of setting it up and running it. 

On a more personal note, I interested in topics at the intersection of religion, science, and philosophy. This is not an area I explore professionally, but always happy to have a cup of coffee over it!

COMMENTED OUT CONTENT
=====================================================
My research interests lie in two broad areas: Computer Systems and Computing Education. More specifically:

+ Computer Systems 
   + Heterogeneous, high-performance computing (HHPC)
   + Low-Carbon and Sustainable computing
   + High-level and accessible programming flows for FPGAs and GPUs, specially for Scientific Computing
   + Performance and energy optimization of scientific models and machine learning 
   + Performance and energy optimization of system software and database management systems

+ Computing Education
  + Competency-based learning and mastery learning
  + Reflective learning
  + Teaching foundational courses in computing
  + Computing and software engineering education for low and middle income countries (LMICs)
  + Use of AI in education

Some of these area were more prominent in my past, some I am currently more active in, and some are best described as _aspirational_. Basically, I'm happy to talk about, supervise, or collaborate in any of these areas.

I am quite keen on working with colleagues from other disciplines, and with international partners. 
  
These days I am actively looking for PhD students, please get in touch if you are interested. I am also very happy to be contacted by University of Glasgow's MSci, MSc, L4 or GA students for project-related discussions.

COMMENTED OUT TEMPLATE
=====================================================
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
A data-driven personal website
 ======
 Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
 
 Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
 
 Getting started
 ======
 1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
 1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
 1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
 1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
 1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
 1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
 
 Site-wide configuration
 ------
 The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 
 
 Create content & metadata
 ------
 For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
 
 **Markdown generator**
 
 I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
 ) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
 
 How to edit your site's GitHub repository
 ------
 Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

 ------
 More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
